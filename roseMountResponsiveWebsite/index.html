            <h1>Rose Mount Pre School</h1>
            <p>
                The Rose Mount Pre School is located in Prayag Pokhari just behind the City Sport council. Its is an
                ideal location for families living near Patan, Gwarko, lagankhel and Jwalakhel.
                <br>
                <br>
                Children can start at the age of two and stay with us until the age of five.
                Our classrooms are bright and airy, and provide the children with creative room for all the activities
                our nursery offers.
                <br>
                <br>
                We highly prioritize the safety of our children and also the enviroment they grow and learn from.
                The Children will learn to care for, and respect each other. Good nursery education is crucial to a child's
                formative years, and fosters an enthusiasm and confidence that will remain with them throughout their school life.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our experienced and dedicated staff help the children to become successful learners, confident individuals,
                and caring contributors to society. The children learn through play and structured lessons, with a balance of
                free choice.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is widely accepted that children in this age group absorb and achieve more than at any other stage in their
                school life, and this makes choosing the right nursery school vital.
